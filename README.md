# Dwarf

Dwarf is still in the very early stages.
The eventual goal is something slightly similar to dwarf fortress.
With an emphasis on modern features such as mouse support, multi-threading, modding, etc.

## Features

### Under Construction 

Psuedo-3D world represented in planes of 2D tiles.

### Notes

Uses a slightly modified version of [Anax](https://github.com/miguelmartin75/anax) 
and incorporates [RLTK's](https://github.com/thebracket/rltk/tree/a18f8c1c5c4117be26423d72300e326a1f83d1ae) system messaging with stored function pointers / message objects for cross system communication.
